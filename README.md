**Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java**

**1. Introduction**
Inheritance and polymorphism are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like Java. They facilitate code reuse, modularity, and extensibility, allowing developers to build complex systems more efficiently. This README provides a summary of inheritance and polymorphism in Java, explaining their concepts, usage, and benefits.

**2. Inheritance**
Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class). In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

**Key Points:**
- Subclass inherits fields and methods from its superclass.
- Subclass can override superclass methods to provide specific implementations.
- Subclass can add new methods and fields.
- Enables code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes.

**Usage Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**3. Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be invoked on objects without knowing their specific type at compile time. In Java, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

**Key Points:**
- Method overriding: Subclasses provide specific implementations of methods defined in the superclass.
- Dynamic method dispatch: The method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
- Method overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters can exist in the same class.

**Usage Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        animal1.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
        animal2.sound(); // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

**4. Benefits of Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- Promotes code reuse and modularity.
- Enhances flexibility and extensibility.
- Supports abstraction and encapsulation.
- Facilitates polymorphic behavior, leading to more robust and adaptable code.

In summary, inheritance and polymorphism are powerful concepts in Java that contribute to building flexible, modular, and maintainable software systems. Understanding and effectively utilizing these concepts can significantly improve the design and implementation of Java applications.
